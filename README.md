# ReactJS FAQ ChatBot

## Project Overview
A simple FAQ chatbot that uses asymmetric semantic search to retrieve the top 3 closest answers from a dataset based on user questions.  This project demonstrates applying NLP embeddings, Python backend APIs and a React frontend in a structured, iterative development process.


## Motivation
I have studied machine learning and have been developing my full-stack skills since graduating. Creating a project that ties the two together felt like the next logical step.  With previous work focusing on user experience, my interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence has always been about how they can support the user.  This project is the perfect first step towards applying a user-centred approach to machine learning by creating a practical tool.


## Goals
- Provide relevant answers to user questions from a pre-defined FAQ dataset.  
- Use semantic search to handle phrasing differences.  
- Build a frontend, backend and a notebook for testing the model.  
- Follow an agile development methodology for development.  


## Tech Stack
- **ML model**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, sentence-transformers (using PyTorch)  
- **Backend**: Python, Flask API  
- **Frontend**: React, Vite  
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub  
- **IDEs**: VSCode  


## Resources
- Dataset: [ReactJS FAQ Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/savanidhruv/reactjs-faq-dataset)  
- Model: [SBERT Semantic Search](https://www.sbert.net/examples/sentence_transformer/applications/semantic-search/README.html)

## Development Methodology and Planning

### Sprint 1: ML Prototype | 17/09/25 – Current
**Plan (17/09/25 – 18/09/25):**
- Define project scope ✅
- Decide tech stack ✅
- Consider approach to solution ✅
- Decide on development methodology ✅
- Gather resources: dataset and pre-trained model ✅
- Create readme structure ✅
- Plan structure of notebook ✅

**Design:**
- Project setup  
- Define preprocessing steps  
- Choose similarity metric  

**Develop:**
- Load dataset  
- Implement preprocessing  
- Generate embeddings  
- Implement function to retrieve top-N answers  

**Test:**
- Run sample queries in notebook  
- Evaluate results on test set  

**Deploy:**
- Notebook prototype runnable locally  

**Review:**
- Analyse results  
- Identify improvements  

---

### Sprint 2: Backend API | Start Goal: 29/09/25
- Wrap ML logic in Flask API  
- Implement API endpoint  
- Test API  

---

### Sprint 3: Frontend | Start Goal: 06/10/25
- Build React form to input questions  
- Display answers  
- Add error handling and UI polish  

---

### Sprint 4+: Integration and Deployment | Start Goal: 13/10/25
- Integrate end-to-end system  
- Consider deployment options  


## Challenges, Actions and Results

- **Challenge**: Understood how to implement a FAQ chatbot that accurately retrieves relevant answers to questions.  
- **Action**: Learned about semantic search and explored the concept of mapping questions to answers in the same vector space.  
- **Result**: Gained understanding of the approach and developed a foundation to start building a ML prototype.
