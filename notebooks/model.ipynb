    "The aim of this notebook is to use asymmetric semantic search to retrieve the top 3 closest answers from the ReactJS FAQ dataset based on a user's question input. Questions and answers are mapped to the same vector space using a pre-trained SBERT model. Given a new question, the closest 3 answers are retrieved using similarity search. The dataset will be split, with 90% used as reference corpus and 10% of questions reserved to evaluate how well the system retrieves relevant answers.\n",

       "      <td>When `React.memo` appears not to work with nested components, it's almost always a misunderstanding of how memoization propagates (or doesn't propagate) down the component tree. `React.memo` only optimizes the component it wraps based on *its direct props*. It doesn't magically memoize its children or components rendered inside it, unless those children are *also* explicitly wrapped with `React.memo`.\\n\\nThe common issues and resolutions are:\\n\\n1.  **Unmemoized Children:** If a memoized parent re-renders (because *its* props changed), and it renders an *unmemoized* child, that child will re-render, even if the child's own props haven't changed. **Resolution:** If the nested child is also expensive and receives stable props, *also* wrap the nested child with `React.memo`.\\n2.  **Unstable Props to Nested Memoized Children:** If a memoized parent passes new object, array, or function references as props to a memoized nested child on every render, the nested child will re-render. **Resolution:** Use `React.useCallback` for functions and `React.useMemo` for objects/arrays in the parent component to stabilize props passed down to memoized children.\\n3.  **Children as `props.children`:** If a parent receives `props.children` and passes them directly to a memoized wrapper, the `children` prop itself can often be unstable (as JSX elements are objects). If `children` changes (e.g., new JSX is rendered), the memoized wrapper might re-render. **Resolution:** If the `children` themselves are static or memoized, `React.memo` can still work. If `children` are dynamic, the memoized wrapper might not be as effective for that specific prop.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport React, { useState, useCallback, useMemo } from 'react';\\n\\n// Level 3: Deeply nested and memoized component\\nconst GrandchildComponent = React.memo(({ value }) =&gt; {\\n  console.log('Rendering GrandchildComponent:', value);\\n  return &lt;p&gt;Grandchild: {value}&lt;/p&gt;;\\n});\\n\\n// Level 2: Nested component, also memoized\\nconst ChildComponent = React.memo(({ count, onAction, data }) =&gt; {\\n  console.log('Rendering ChildComponent:', count);\\n  return (\\n    &lt;div style={{ border: '1px dotted green', padding: '10px', margin: '5px' }}&gt;\\n      &lt;h4&gt;Child: {count}&lt;/h4&gt;\\n      &lt;button onClick={onAction}&gt;Child Action&lt;/button&gt;\\n      &lt;GrandchildComponent value={data.nestedValue} /&gt;\\n    &lt;/div&gt;\\n  );\\n});\\n\\n// Level 1: Parent component\\nexport default function App() {\\n  const [appCount, setAppCount] = useState(0);\\n\\n  // Memoize the callback passed to ChildComponent\\n  const handleChildAction = useCallback(() =&gt; {\\n    console.log('Child action triggered!');\\n  }, []);\\n\\n  // Memoize the data object passed to ChildComponent (and then GrandchildComponent)\\n  const memoizedData = useMemo(() =&gt; ({ nestedValue: 100 }), []);\\n\\n  return (\\n    &lt;div style={{ border: '1px solid red', padding: '20px' }}&gt;\\n      &lt;h1&gt;App Count: {appCount}&lt;/h1&gt;\\n      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setAppCount(appCount + 1)}&gt;Increment App Count&lt;/button&gt;\\n      \\n      {/* ChildComponent will only re-render if appCount changes, or if handleChildAction/memoizedData change */}\\n      &lt;ChildComponent \\n        count={appCount} \\n        onAction={handleChildAction} \\n        data={memoizedData} \\n      /&gt;\\n\\n      {/* If you pass an unstable object, ChildComponent AND GrandchildComponent will re-render unnecessarily */}\\n      {/* &lt;ChildComponent \\n        count={appCount} \\n        onAction={handleChildAction} \\n        data={{ nestedValue: 200 }} \\n      /&gt; */}\\n    &lt;/div&gt;\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\n`React.memo` is local optimization. For effective memoization of nested components, ensure each component in the hierarchy is memoized if appropriate, and that stable props are passed down the chain using `useCallback` and `useMemo`.</td>\n",

Use polyfills if needed and test against your browser support matrix. Also avoid using unsupported CSS features in your list styles.   \n",

The function passed to `React.lazy` must use the dynamic `import()` syntax and return a Promise that resolves to the component.\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport React, { lazy } from 'react';\\n\\nconst MyLazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./MyComponent'));\\n// Then, use it inside a Suspense boundary:\\n// function App() {\\n//   return (\\n//     <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>\\n//       <MyLazyComponent />\\n//     </Suspense>\\n//   );\\n// }\\n```\\nIt's crucial that `MyComponent` has a `default export`.   \n",
       "2  When `React.memo` appears not to work with nested components, it's almost always a misunderstanding of how memoization propagates (or doesn't propagate) down the component tree. `React.memo` only optimizes the component it wraps based on *its direct props*. It doesn't magically memoize its children or components rendered inside it, unless those children are *also* explicitly wrapped with `React.memo`.\\n\\nThe common issues and resolutions are:\\n\\n1.  **Unmemoized Children:** If a memoized parent re-renders (because *its* props changed), and it renders an *unmemoized* child, that child will re-render, even if the child's own props haven't changed. **Resolution:** If the nested child is also expensive and receives stable props, *also* wrap the nested child with `React.memo`.\\n2.  **Unstable Props to Nested Memoized Children:** If a memoized parent passes new object, array, or function references as props to a memoized nested child on every render, the nested child will re-render. **Resolution:** Use `React.useCallback` for functions and `React.useMemo` for objects/arrays in the parent component to stabilize props passed down to memoized children.\\n3.  **Children as `props.children`:** If a parent receives `props.children` and passes them directly to a memoized wrapper, the `children` prop itself can often be unstable (as JSX elements are objects). If `children` changes (e.g., new JSX is rendered), the memoized wrapper might re-render. **Resolution:** If the `children` themselves are static or memoized, `React.memo` can still work. If `children` are dynamic, the memoized wrapper might not be as effective for that specific prop.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport React, { useState, useCallback, useMemo } from 'react';\\n\\n// Level 3: Deeply nested and memoized component\\nconst GrandchildComponent = React.memo(({ value }) => {\\n  console.log('Rendering GrandchildComponent:', value);\\n  return <p>Grandchild: {value}</p>;\\n});\\n\\n// Level 2: Nested component, also memoized\\nconst ChildComponent = React.memo(({ count, onAction, data }) => {\\n  console.log('Rendering ChildComponent:', count);\\n  return (\\n    <div style={{ border: '1px dotted green', padding: '10px', margin: '5px' }}>\\n      <h4>Child: {count}</h4>\\n      <button onClick={onAction}>Child Action</button>\\n      <GrandchildComponent value={data.nestedValue} />\\n    </div>\\n  );\\n});\\n\\n// Level 1: Parent component\\nexport default function App() {\\n  const [appCount, setAppCount] = useState(0);\\n\\n  // Memoize the callback passed to ChildComponent\\n  const handleChildAction = useCallback(() => {\\n    console.log('Child action triggered!');\\n  }, []);\\n\\n  // Memoize the data object passed to ChildComponent (and then GrandchildComponent)\\n  const memoizedData = useMemo(() => ({ nestedValue: 100 }), []);\\n\\n  return (\\n    <div style={{ border: '1px solid red', padding: '20px' }}>\\n      <h1>App Count: {appCount}</h1>\\n      <button onClick={() => setAppCount(appCount + 1)}>Increment App Count</button>\\n      \\n      {/* ChildComponent will only re-render if appCount changes, or if handleChildAction/memoizedData change */}\\n      <ChildComponent \\n        count={appCount} \\n        onAction={handleChildAction} \\n        data={memoizedData} \\n      />\\n\\n      {/* If you pass an unstable object, ChildComponent AND GrandchildComponent will re-render unnecessarily */}\\n      {/* <ChildComponent \\n        count={appCount} \\n        onAction={handleChildAction} \\n        data={{ nestedValue: 200 }} \\n      /> */}\\n    </div>\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\n`React.memo` is local optimization. For effective memoization of nested components, ensure each component in the hierarchy is memoized if appropriate, and that stable props are passed down the chain using `useCallback` and `useMemo`.   \n",

Use `console.log()` to compare SSR and client output.\\n2. Avoid accessing `window`, `document`, or random values (like `Math.random()`) during render.\\n3. Use `useEffect()` to defer client-specific code.\\n4. Consistently render components and avoid conditional rendering that differs between client and server.\\n5. Wrap dynamic parts like dates in `useEffect()` or SSR them with consistent values.   \n",

Or, place a `useLazyLoadQuery` directly in the routed component, wrapped in a `<Suspense>` boundary. For server-rendered apps, preload the query in the router and hydrate it into the Relay environment. This ensures fast, coordinated routing and data rendering.   \n",
